# Brand Brief

You capture a small business owner's context once, save it to a file, and let every other content skill reference it. Without this, AI output is generic. With it, every post is specific to their business, audience, and voice.

This skill is the **foundation**. It runs once on day one and gets updated maybe quarterly.

## When to Activate

- User says "set up my brand," "save my business info," "update my brand brief," "I want my posts to sound like my business."
- Another skill (like `content-coach` or `post-writer`) needs context but `brand-brief.md` doesn't exist yet.
- User wants to refresh an outdated brief.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check for existing brief

Look for `brand-brief.md` in the current directory.

- **If exists**: Read it. Ask "Want to update what's there, or start fresh?"
- **If new**: Skip to Step 2.

### Step 2: Ask 6 questions, one at a time

Don't dump all 6 at once. Ask one. Wait for the answer. Ask the next. Each answer should be 1-3 sentences. If they give you 1 word, ask a gentle follow-up.

**1. What's your business — what do you sell?**

Looking for: the product or service, in plain words. "Handmade soy candles" beats "wellness lifestyle products."

**2. Who's your customer — describe one real person who buys from you.**

Looking for: a specific human, not a demographic. "Mid-30s women who hate the smell of synthetic candles and want their house to feel cozy" beats "women 25-45."

If they say "everyone," push back: "Pick one. Which type buys most often, or which type do you wish bought more?"

**3. What's the one action you want someone to take after seeing your posts?**

Looking for: a single verb. Buy, follow, sign up for the newsletter, DM you, visit the website. ONE thing. If they list 3, ask which is most important.

**4. What's a strong opinion you have about your industry — something most people doing what you do would push back on?**

Looking for: a real wedge. The contrarian belief. The thing they argue with peers about. This is the **single biggest viral fuel** in their entire brief. Without it, every post sounds like every other small business.

If they say "I don't really have one," push: "Pick something. What's a habit other [industry] people have that you think is a mistake? What's a piece of common advice you ignore? What do customers thank you for that competitors don't do?" Get something specific, even if it's small.

If they're still stuck, this is a flag — note it in the brief and tell them: "We'll come back to this. Strong opinions are how posts go viral. Watch for what bothers you when you scroll competitor content this week."

**5. Tell me one recent story, win, or thing that happened in your business.**

Looking for: a real, specific moment. A customer review. A mistake they fixed. A milestone. This becomes raw material for posts later. If they don't have one, ask: "What's the most common question customers ask you?"

**6. What's your voice — pick the closest 2-3 from this list, or describe it yourself.**

Options: warm and personal, witty and dry, raw and honest, professional and clean, playful and irreverent, expert and authoritative, scrappy and underdog.

Or have them describe it in 5 words.

### Step 3: Write the brief to a file

Save to `brand-brief.md` in the current directory:

```markdown
# Brand Brief

> Captured: [today's date]
> Update this file as the business evolves.

## Business
[What they sell, in plain words]

## Customer
[The specific person — what they want, what they hate, where they hang out if mentioned]

## Primary CTA
[The one action]

## Strong Opinion / Wedge
[The contrarian belief from Q4 — something most people in their industry would push back on. This is the viral fuel. Reference it when generating contrarian-take and "most people think X" posts.]

## Story Vault
- [Story 1 from their answer to Q5]
- [Add more over time]

## Voice
[2-3 voice traits + 5-word self-description if given]

## Universal Voice Rules (apply to every post)
- Contractions always ("don't" not "do not")
- Active voice, short sentences
- Address the reader as "you"
- Numbers as digits ("3 tips" not "three tips")
- No em dashes — use commas, periods, or "..."
- One concrete idea per post, not three
- Specific details over generic statements
```

### Step 4: Confirm

Show them the file. Ask: "This is what I saved. Anything to fix or add?"

If they're happy, you're done. Any future skill can now read this file.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't ask 10 questions. Five. That's it. They'll bail otherwise.
- Don't write their voice section in marketing-speak ("authentic, value-driven, customer-centric"). Use their actual words.
- Don't invent details. If they didn't answer something, leave it blank or put "TBD."
- Don't treat this as a one-time fixed document. Tell them: "Update this whenever your business changes — new product, new audience, new vibe."
- Don't ask about social platforms here. That's for the post itself.

## Why This File Matters

Every other skill in this set reads `brand-brief.md` first. Without it:
- `post-writer` produces generic posts that could be for any business
- `content-coach` ideates without context, suggesting irrelevant topics
- `post-grader` can't check if the voice matches because there's no defined voice

With it, every output sounds like *their* business, not a content template.
