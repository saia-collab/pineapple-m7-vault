# Question Library

Per-archetype question chains. Each question is a phrasing the SKILL.md interview reads aloud (verbatim or close to it). Plain-English jargon translation is built into the question itself.

Order matters. Each question feeds the data map JSON. Keep the conversation moving — if a question doesn't apply to the operator, skip and move on.

## content_creator

This archetype covers solo newsletter operators, YouTubers, podcasters, course creators, and any hybrid of the above. Reframe every "where does X live" question so "I don't have one" is always a clean first-class answer. Never push the operator to pick a tool when their honest answer is "no system yet."

### Pantry questions (outcome-first, never tool-first)

1. **What you publish** *"What do you publish, and where? A newsletter, videos, a podcast, a course, or a mix?"*
2. **Audience** *"Roughly how big is your audience today? Subscribers, viewers, community members, however you count it."*
3. **Past content corpus** *"You've made stuff already. Where do past pieces live? YouTube channel, Substack archive, Apple Podcasts, your laptop, somewhere else? It's fine if it's just 'YouTube auto-captions and that's it.'"*
4. **Community** *"Do you have a place where your audience hangs out together? A Skool, Discord, Facebook group, Slack, paid Circle, etc.? Or just comments and DMs? Both are valid answers."* (If "no community", capture as `community: none`. Don't push to pick a tool.)
5. **Paid offer** *"Are you selling anything direct to your audience? A Gumroad product, a course, a paid newsletter tier, coaching, sponsorships? Or not yet?"*
6. **Email list** *"Where does your email list live? Substack, Beehiiv, Kit (formerly ConvertKit), or somewhere else? Do you also use a separate transactional email tool like Loops.so or Resend for things like purchase confirmations?"*
7. **Audience research** *"How do you decide what to publish next? Gut + Twitter scrolling, or do you actually look at past performance and audience replies?"* (Maps to `competitor_research` + `audience_signal` items in pantry.)
8. **Vault / notes** *"Where do your drafts, ideas, frameworks live? Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes, Google Docs, mix of all four?"*
9. **Transactional email** *"When someone buys, how do they hear from you? Gumroad sends one email by default. Are you using Loops.so, Resend, or just letting Gumroad do it?"*

### Existing automation questions

10. *"Are you running any AI tools in your workflow today? ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, anything custom?"*
11. *"Any scheduled jobs or Zapier-style automations? Even one Zap counts. If 'none', that's a clean answer."*

### Outcome reality check (NOT schema-shaped questions)

12. *"How often do you publish each thing? Weekly newsletter? One video a week? Podcast every other week?"* (Maps to `cadence` in tool_defaults.)
13. *"What's the single hardest, most-repeated weekly task you'd love to take off your plate?"* (Anchors recipe selection in Stage 6.5.)
14. *"Are you paying for any tool whose data you basically never look at? Klaviyo collecting dust, Hotjar untouched, anything like that?"* (Flags `paying_unused: true` in pantry.)

## other / custom

If `archetype = other`, ask three Complimentary-text follow-ups before pulling questions:

1. *"How does money come in? Walk me through one customer's path from finding you to paying."*
2. *"What does your team do day-to-day? Top 3-4 tasks that fill the week."*
3. *"What's the single hardest, most-repeated weekly thing you'd love to take off your plate?"*

Synthesize the answers into a custom question chain. Most "other" businesses are hybrids of two standard archetypes (e.g., service-based marketplace = saas + local_trades).
