# Business Archetypes

Nine archetypes the silver-platter interview can match to. If the operator's business doesn't fit any cleanly, set archetype to `other` and ask 2-3 Complimentary-text follow-ups.

## ecommerce

**One-liner:** Sells physical or digital products via online store. Order-driven. Inventory and refund flows.

**Typical stack:** Shopify or WooCommerce or BigCommerce, Stripe, Klaviyo, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, Google Ads, customer support inbox, vendor / supplier communication.

**Pain pattern:** Founder argues weekly about which SKU tier is profitable; refund emails scattered across two inboxes; ad spend tracked in three spreadsheets that don't agree; survey responses pile up unread.

**Typical agent hierarchy:**
- EA Orchestrator (chief-of-staff)
  - CFO bot (finance silver platter)
  - CMO bot (marketing + customer voice)
  - Ops bot (inventory, schedule)

**Question seeds** (delivered with jargon translation):
1. Where do orders live? Most shops use Shopify or WooCommerce. What about you?
2. Where does ad spend live? Meta and TikTok export XLSX, Google exports CSV.
3. Where do refunds happen? Email? Shopify directly? A separate help desk?
4. Where do customer surveys live? Klaviyo, Typeform, manual?
5. How do you decide what to put on sale? Gut, or data?
6. Do you have any kind of weekly P&L view today?

**Typical stack:** GitHub, Linear or Jira, Stripe, Pendo or Mixpanel, Intercom or Zendesk, Sentry, Slack, customer call recordings (Otter / Fireflies / Gong).

**Pain pattern:** Engineering manager is the human router between support and engineering; pickup latency on bug fixes is weeks; customer feedback drowns in noise; churn investigations take days because data lives in five places.

**Typical agent hierarchy:**
- Triage Orchestrator (chief-of-staff for engineering)
  - Root-Cause Analyst (joins tickets + commits + customer calls)
  - Codex-Fix-Drafter (opens git worktree, drafts code change)
  - Customer-Voice Distiller (clusters Pendo / Intercom into themes)

**Question seeds:**
1. Where do customer support tickets live? Intercom, Zendesk, email?
2. How do you collect product feedback? Pendo, NPS, calls, forms?
3. How do you track engineering work? Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues?
4. How long does it take from "we found a bug" to "we shipped a fix"?

**Typical stack:** iManage or NetDocuments (law), Bill4Time or Clio (billing), Outlook + Microsoft 365, LexisNexis (law), Bedrock-hosted Claude (regulated AI deployment), DocuSign.

**Pain pattern:** Every new matter / engagement gets hand-rolled from scratch; time entries are days late; institutional knowledge dies when partners retire; ethics walling between matters is enforced by hope.

**Typical agent hierarchy:**
- Case-Launch Orchestrator (chief-of-staff for matter intake)
  - Billing Assistant (drafts time-entry narratives)
  - Deposition / Memo Specialist (drafts focus-areas briefs from matter files)
  - Post-Mortem Distiller (closed matters only — separates ephemeral from firm-knowledge)

**Question seeds:**
1. Where do matter files live? iManage, NetDocuments, SharePoint, file server?
2. How do you handle time entries today? Bill4Time? Clio?
3. How do you wall matters from each other? File system? Permission groups?

## healthcare_clinic

**One-liner:** Patient-facing practice (specialty or general). Regulated by HIPAA. Provider-driven workflow with admin support.

**Typical stack:** EHR (eClinicalWorks, Athena, Epic, Cerner) — exports DOCX, Centricity or other practice-management software, paper intake forms, faxed insurance appeals, Bedrock-hosted Claude under BAA.

**Pain pattern:** Practice manager prints intake forms each morning and walks them down the hall; lab results don't auto-summarize; insurance appeals run 6-8 weeks because each is written from scratch; PHI scoping is enforced by hope.

**Typical agent hierarchy:**
- Care Coordinator Orchestrator (chief-of-staff for the morning huddle)
  - Intake-Prep Specialist (provider morning briefs)
  - Lab Review Specialist (abnormal flags only)
  - Billing-Appeals Specialist (controlled cross-domain access for appeals only)

2. How do patient intake forms get into the system today? Paper, tablet, web?
3. Where do lab results land? In the EHR? Faxed?
4. Who reviews labs each morning, and how long does it take?

**Typical stack:** Bloomberg Terminal, internal research portal (Notion / DOCX), position management in Excel + custom Python, Outlook for LP comms, signed PDFs for compliance pre-clears.

**Pain pattern:** PM reads 80-100 research notes a week with no clustering; LP letters take 3-4 days each (same arc, different quarter); compliance pre-clears slow operations; trade idea triage is gut-feel.

**Typical stack:** YouTube Studio, podcast host (Spotify / Apple), newsletter platform (Beehiiv / Substack), Skool or Circle community, Gumroad or Stripe for paid content, Apify for competitor scraping, Notion / Obsidian for vault.

**Pain pattern:** Each video is a 30-asset pipeline (titles, thumbnails, hooks, diagrams, demos, filming guide, audio walkthrough, kit, description, SEO, pinned). Without a system it eats the week.

  - Research Distiller (competitor + transcripts)

**Typical stack:** MLS access via regional board, Zillow + Realtor.com inbound, Top Producer or kvCORE CRM, DocuSign, Google Calendar for showings, Yelp / Google reviews.

- Daily Operator Orchestrator
  - Dispatcher (tomorrow's brief)
  - Review Responder (drafts replies for owner approval)
  - Weekly P&L Summary

## other / custom

If the operator's business doesn't fit cleanly:

> "Tell me more about how money comes in (revenue side) and what your team does day-to-day (operations side). I'll build the question chain from there."

Set archetype to `other` and ask 2-3 Complimentary-text follow-ups before launching into the question chain. Use the answers to seed a custom question chain (most likely a hybrid of two of the standard archetypes).
