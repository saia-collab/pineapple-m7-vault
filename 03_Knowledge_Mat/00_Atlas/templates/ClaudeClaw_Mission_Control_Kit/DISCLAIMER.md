## What this kit is

The ClaudeClaw Mission Control Kit is a snapshot of ClaudeClaw V3 — Mark Kashef's personal AI agentic operating system as of May 2026. It packages the architecture as a set of prompts, templates, blueprints, power packs, and reference guides so a motivated person can rebuild the system from scratch on their own machine using their own Claude Code subscription. The Hive Mind (shared memory state with list/2D/3D views) is one feature within ClaudeClaw — this kit covers the full system. It is the architecture Mark showcases in his V3 video on YouTube.

It is provided as a self-serve reverse-engineering aid. Everything in this kit is meant to give you enough information to build a functionally similar system yourself, using your own Claude Code subscription, your own machine, and your own choices about which features to include.

## What this kit is NOT

- It is **not a turnkey production system**. The kit does not include precompiled binaries, packaged installers, or a ready-to-run application.
- It is **not financial, legal, business, security, or compliance advice**.
- It is **not a guarantee** of any specific outcome, performance, savings, or revenue.
- It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Telegram, Slack, Discord, or any other platform mentioned. All trademarks belong to their respective owners.
- It is **not a substitute** for your own judgment about whether this setup is right for you.

## Experimental nature

The patterns and prompts in this kit reflect an evolving personal system as of May 2026. The system is experimental in the following ways:

- APIs change. Claude Code, Gemini, and other tools referenced may release breaking updates that invalidate prompts, configurations, or assumptions in this kit.
- Best practices evolve. Patterns considered safe today may need revision tomorrow.
- Edge cases exist. Multi-agent systems with shared databases, message queues, scheduled tasks, and external integrations have failure modes that may not be fully documented here.
- Dependencies are external. Anything that calls another company's API depends on that company continuing to provide the API on the same terms.

If you build a system using this kit, you are building an experimental piece of infrastructure. Treat it accordingly.

## Your responsibilities

By using this kit you accept that you are responsible for:

1. **Reviewing every prompt and configuration** before pasting it into Claude Code or running it on your machine. Generated code can have bugs, security issues, or unintended behavior. You must inspect what runs.
2. **Securing your API keys**. Treat Claude Code OAuth tokens, Telegram bot tokens, OpenAI keys, Gemini keys, and any other credentials as sensitive. Do not commit them to git. Do not paste them into screenshots. Rotate them if exposed.
3. **Managing API costs**. Claude, Gemini, and other LLM APIs charge per token. Multi-agent systems and scheduled tasks can accumulate costs quickly if misconfigured. You are responsible for monitoring your spend and setting limits where the platform allows.
4. **Protecting any data** you process through this system. If you connect this to your email, calendar, Slack, or other private channels, you are routing private data through your local machine and through any APIs you choose to use. You are responsible for your own data hygiene and compliance posture.
5. **Doing your own due diligence** on whether this architecture fits your needs, your security requirements, your business obligations, your local laws, and your appetite for tinkering with experimental software.
6. **Backing up your work**. If you build on top of this kit, back up your database, your agent configurations, your skills, and your memory store. Things break. Disks fail. Migrations go sideways.

## Use at your own risk

The author makes no representation that this kit, the patterns it describes, or any system built using its guidance will be Complimentary of defects, secure, fit for any particular purpose, or compliant with any specific standard or regulation.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, and all liability for any damages, direct or indirect, arising from the use of this kit or any system derived from it, including but not limited to data loss, financial loss, security incidents, service outages, business interruption, or any other adverse outcome.

If you cannot accept these terms, do not use the kit. Request a refund and move on.

## Final note

This kit is generous because the goal is to teach the architecture, not to gatekeep it. If you reverse-engineer the whole system from these documents and never join the community, that is a successful outcome. If you join the community for direct support, you get the carbon-copy repo plus access to the people building variants alongside you. Both paths are valid.

Build carefully. Test what you ship. Question every assumption.
