# 📅 Agent OS — What's New, by Day

The newest changes are at the top. Each entry is what changed for **you** — new features ✨, fixes 🔧, and improvements ⚡. Updating is one double-click: see `UPDATE.md`.

---

## 2026-08-03
- 🦀 **New tab: jcode.** A featherweight open-source **Rust** coding agent (~28MB of RAM, instant start) with a semantic memory graph — and it runs on your **existing Claude subscription**, no new API key. Sessions get animal names and show up in the tab's History panel. Setup: `install/39-JCODE.md`.
- 🎨 **New tab: Higgsfield.** Generate AI **images and video** with Higgsfield — driven through Hermes via Higgsfield's official MCP server, with every asset auto-saved to the tab's gallery. One-time `hermes mcp login higgsfield` sign-in. Setup: `install/40-HIGGSFIELD.md`.
- 🔧 **Portability:** the Higgsfield tab uses your **active Hermes profile** (never a hardcoded name); pin one with `HIGGS_PROFILE` if you want.

## 2026-07-31
- 🐋 **New tab: DeepSeek Coder.** Chat + build with **DeepSeek V4 Flash** (today's public beta) on DeepSeek's **official** API — a very cheap, very fast reasoning coder, with a workspace for the files it writes. One key, 2-minute setup: `install/37-DEEPSEEK-CODER.md`.
- 🎯 **New SEO sub-tab: Parasite SEO.** One-keyword arbitrage: pick a query you already rank for and get ready platform-native plays — X thread, Instagram Reel, TikTok/YouTube Short — each with a Claude-ready prompt (posts route to the Claude tab, video scripts to the Video Director). Uses your existing Search Console connection, and auto-detects Google's new GSC *platform properties* the moment their API opens. Guide: `install/38-PARASITE-SEO.md`.

## 2026-07-30
- 👂 **"Hey Hermes" wake word.** Tap the ear at the top of the Hermes tab and just say *"hey hermes"* — hands-free voice, detected **on-device** (openwakeword), so nothing leaves your Mac while it listens. Works with your active Hermes profile. Guide: `install/4-HERMES.md`.
- 🔀 **Free Claude Code gets a router switch.** Flip between **OmniRoute** (90+ keyless free providers, the default) and **9Router** (free router with the RTK token saver — 20–40% fewer tokens — and your-accounts fallback). The panel tells you exactly what to run if one's down. Guide: `install/5-FREE-CLAUDE-CODE.md`.
- 🧹 **Talk sub-tab removed** from Hermes. One voice path instead of two: real-time voice is **Hermes-Jarvis** (plus the new wake word). Less to set up, less to break.
- 🔧 **Works-on-your-Mac fixes:** the wake word, Grok media (Hermes Studio) and Hy3 Coder now read your **active Hermes profile** instead of assuming a specific profile name existed.

## 2026-07-24
- 🚀 **Claude Opus 5 is here — and it's the new default.** The Claude tab and the SEO engine now use **Claude Opus 5** (`claude-opus-5`), Anthropic's newest flagship (launched today). There's nothing to install — if your Claude CLI/plan has Opus 5, it just works. Want the previous Opus 4.8 or the Mythos-class Claude 5 instead? Change one line in `~/.agentic-os/config.json` — full steps in `install/7-AGENT-CLIS.md`.

## 2026-07-21
- 🧠 **New brain: Qwen 3.8.** The **GPT 5.6 Code** tab now lets you build with Alibaba's 2.4T flagship **Qwen 3.8** (via the Qoder agent) — GoldieBench #5, tied with Fable 5 — alongside GPT 5.6, GLM-5.2 and Kimi K3. Pick it in the model dropdown; one-time Qoder setup is in `install/27-GLM-CODE.md`. (That guide is also renamed to match the tab's real name, "GPT 5.6 Code", and now covers all four brains.)

## 2026-07-18
- 🔍 **SEO → Research is fixed + now yours.** The tab pulls live keyword opportunities from **your own** Google Search Console. Two things were wrong before: the research script wasn't shipped ("research script missing"), and the fallback site list was someone else's domains. Now the connect script ships (`scripts/gsc-connect.py`) — do a ~5-min one-time Google authorization and the tab reads *your* verified sites. Full steps: `install/36-SEO-RESEARCH.md`. (Thanks to the member who reported this. 🙏)

## 2026-07-17
- 🛑 **Clearer start:** a note up top that Agent OS is a **desktop app you run on your own computer** — don't upload the zip into the Claude/ChatGPT website chat (it won't run there, and Claude won't copy a paid product's code). Unzip it and double-click `Start Agent OS.command`.
- ⚡ **Latest build refreshed.** Same tabs, newest under-the-hood fixes bundled — double-click `Update Agent OS.command` to pull it in (keeps all your settings, keys, and notes).

## 2026-07-16
- 🧑‍💻 **New tab: opencode.** The open-source `opencode` terminal coding agent (160k★) now has its own tab — with built-in free models, it builds real apps for **$0, no API key**. Install with `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`. Guide: `install/34-OPENCODE.md`.
- 🧪 **New tab: App Lab.** A catalog of ready-to-run AI apps (Free Mixture-of-Agents, chat-with-any-webpage, AI travel planner) adapted to run entirely on **free cloud models**. Guide: `install/35-APP-LAB.md`.

## 2026-07-13
- 🖼️ **Thumbnail Studio now researches + designs for YOU.** Give it a topic and it live-searches what's winning on YouTube right now, then designs **6 distinct thumbnail concepts** (faceless, or with your own photo). Set your channel once with `"youtubeChannel"` in `~/.agentic-os/config.json` for channel-tuned research. Guide: `install/10-THUMBNAIL-STUDIO.md`.

## 2026-07-10
- 🪟 **Easier to find the Windows guide + roadmap.** Step one is now an OS picker (Mac / Windows / Linux) and the **Windows install guide** + **30-Day Roadmap** are linked right at the top of the README — no more hunting. (A few Windows noobs couldn't find them.)

## 2026-07-09
- ⚡ **Grok Build now runs on grok-4.5.** xAI's terminal coding agent (signed in on your X Premium+ plan) got the model bump — same tab, stronger builds. Guide: `install/18-GROK-BUILD.md`.
- 🔒 **Updates no longer touch your keys or config — this was a real bug, now fixed.** All four update paths (the `.command`, the Windows steps, and the AI updater) now explicitly protect `.env`, `.env.local` and `agentic-os.config.json` from being deleted during an update. We also point you to `~/.agentic-os/config.json` (which lives *outside* the app folder and is never touched). Huge thanks to **Chris Martin** for the detailed report. If you keep settings, keep them in `~/.agentic-os/config.json`.
- 🧹 **Removed the Build Guide tab** to keep the sidebar focused.
- 💡 **Free Claude Code — hit a daily rate limit (429)?** The guide now explains it: OpenRouter's free tier is 50 requests/day; add $5 of credits for 1,000/day, or switch to the Local model for unlimited free. (Thanks **Karim Traore**.)

## 2026-07-08
- 🎞️ **New tab: Video Editor.** Edit any video by chatting — upload a clip, say *"cut the dead air, add subtitles"*, get a finished `final.mp4`. Powered by the video-use skill + ffmpeg. Guide: `install/33-VIDEO-EDITOR.md`.
- 🏢 **New guide: SEO Office.** The **SEO → SEO Office** sub-tab (a local SEO agency OS — 3D office, claude-seo agents) now has setup steps: clone it from GitHub + `pnpm dev`. Guide: `install/32-SEO-OFFICE.md`.
- 🔌 **New: the "Connect Everything" setup guide** (`SETUP-GUIDE.md`, linked at the top). No more guessing how to link each model/tool/API — it leads with the easy path (paste one sentence to Claude/Hermes and it wires every key for you), then a plain reference table of what each key unlocks + where to get it, plus dead-simple CLI setup (install + log in, nothing to edit).
- 🔢 **The dashboard now shows its build version.** Look under the "Agentic OS" logo (top-left) — it shows `build <date>`. Now you can tell at a glance whether you're on the latest pack; if it's older than the newest in the AI Profit Boardroom, run `Update Agent OS.command`.

## 2026-07-07
- ⚡ **New tab: Hy3 Coder.** Fast, cheap one-shot builds powered by **Tencent Hy3** (Hunyuan 3, an open-weights coder) through OpenRouter — describe it, watch it stream a full single-file build, grab the result. A few cents a build. Guide: `install/31-HY3-CODER.md`.

## 2026-07-06
- 📖 **Documented every tab.** Swept the whole dashboard so nothing's a mystery — the **Local** tab (chat with models on your own Mac) and the **SEO → Transcripts** tool now have proper entries too.
- 🔭 **New guide: Hermes Astros.** The **Hermes → Hermes Astros** sub-tab is a 24/7 **YouTube** watcher (sibling of The Radar, which watches X): it scans the channels in your niche and hands you trending video ideas with ready titles + SEO keywords. Works with **zero setup** (keyless), or add a YouTube key for richer data. Guide: `install/30-ASTROS.md`.
- 📊 **New guide: OpenSEO.** The **SEO → OpenSEO** sub-tab (a free, self-hosted Semrush/Ahrefs alternative — keyword research, rank tracking, backlinks, site audits, on your own DataForSEO key, running locally in Docker) now has a proper setup guide: `install/29-OPENSEO.md`. It was already in the dashboard but undocumented; now you can actually set it up.

## 2026-07-05
- 🧭 **New tab: OmniRoute.** Build with AI for **$0** by routing every message across **90+ free providers** with automatic fallback — no API key, nothing leaves your Mac. Install with `npm install -g omniroute` and go. Guide: `install/28-OMNIROUTE.md`.
- ✅ **New: Implementation Checklist.** A simple tick-box list to get a fresh install up and running (`IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md`, linked at the top of the README) — only four steps to a working dashboard.

## 2026-07-03
- 🖼️ **Thumbnail Studio now actually includes its generator.** The doc told you to copy `generate.py` from `extras/thumbnail-generator/`, but that folder was empty — so the tool couldn't run. Fixed: the pack now ships **both** `generate.py` and its `text_overlay.py` helper, and the copy step grabs both. (Thanks **Nova Autonomous** for spotting it.)
- 🔧 **Hermes no longer breaks on a missing profile.** If a Hermes "profile" was selected or left over that doesn't exist on your machine (e.g. `kimi`), *every* message failed with `Profile 'kimi' does not exist`. Now Agent OS quietly ignores a profile that isn't there and falls back to your default, and a stale selection resets itself — so it just works. (Thanks **Klaki Ai**.) *If you still see it, run `hermes profile list` and `hermes profile use <one-that-exists>`.*

## 2026-06-30
- 💻 **New tab: GLM Code.** Runs the *real* Claude Code coding agent, but on **GLM-5.2** (via Ollama Cloud) instead of Anthropic — the same build-a-whole-app experience at a fraction of the per-token cost. Great for web apps and tools. Needs Claude Code + Ollama (which you likely already have) + a free Ollama account. Guide: `install/27-GLM-CODE.md`.
- 🔧 **Agent Kanban — SEO mode polish.** The Hermes cloud SEO mode that plans + writes full articles now signs them with **your** name and writes in a generic voice (config-driven), not a hardcoded one.

## 2026-06-29
- 🎬 **New tab: OpenMontage.** Describe a scene in a few words and it generates cinematic shots, then assembles them into a short, graded, moving video. Two modes: **Cinematic** (cheap + fast still-shots with motion, ~$0.30) and **Movie** (real motion clips, premium). Uses your existing OpenRouter key + ffmpeg. Guide: `install/26-OPENMONTAGE.md`.
- ⚡ **Hermes Mixture-of-Agents (MoA).** The Hermes tab can now run several models together and blend their answers for tougher questions — a built-in "council" for higher-quality replies.
- 🔧 **Outreach polish.** The email-outreach tool got more writing/inbox/send wiring, and now signs emails with **your** name (config-driven), not a hardcoded one.

## 2026-06-27
- 🪟 **Windows users now have a clear install guide.** New `install/25-WINDOWS-INSTALL.md` — beginner-friendly Windows setup. The double-click `.command` files are Mac-only, so this shows the two easy Windows paths (let an AI do it, or 3 PowerShell commands), confirms every tab works the same, and lists the few Windows gotchas + fixes. The README now signposts Windows **right at the first step** so you're never stuck. (Thanks **Ronald Hutto** for flagging it.)
- 🗺️ **Added the 30-Day Roadmap.** New `30-DAY-ROADMAP.md` — a simple day-by-day plan from "just installed" to running an AI-first operation, linked from the top of the README. It was mentioned but hadn't actually shipped in the zip — now it's here.

## 2026-06-26
- 📦 **Latest build.** A fresh dated build so you know you're current — it bundles everything from the last few days: the **Codex approval dropdown** (no more permission loops), the **Windows one-Hermes-home** unification (`HERMES_HOME`), and the new **Leads** + **Radar** tabs. No new features since 2026-06-25 — see the entries below for what each one does.

## 2026-06-25
- 🛠️ **Codex no longer gets stuck asking for permission.** Codex runs headlessly inside Agent OS, so its terminal "approve this?" prompt had nowhere to show in the browser — it could freeze in an approval loop (*"grant file-edit permission so I can proceed?"* → you say yes → it asks again). Codex Chat + Goal Mode now have an approval dropdown: **✅ Auto-approve** (default — works in a sandbox that can write to your project), **👀 Ask (read-only)** (it plans but won't change files), and **🚀 YOLO** (no sandbox, full access — back up first). Thanks to **Bryan Popham** for the clear bug report + fix. *(If Codex says your login expired, run `codex login` once.)*
- 🪟 **Windows: one Hermes home, no more split state.** Agent OS now reads the `HERMES_HOME` environment variable (the same one the Hermes CLI uses) — so a single setting points both at the same folder, instead of Agent OS being stuck on `~/.hermes` while native Windows Hermes lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`. Default is unchanged (`~/.hermes`), so existing setups behave exactly as before. New guide: `install/24-WINDOWS-STATE-AND-MEMORY.md` — unify your Hermes homes + set up one shared Obsidian memory across Agent OS, Hermes, Codex and Paperclip.

## 2026-06-24
- ✨ **New tab: Leads** — find real people to reach out to. Describe your ideal customer (or paste a domain/CSV list) and it returns scored contacts with emails, ready to feed your outreach. Start **free** (Hunter free tier + CSV); add Apollo/Firecrawl for more volume. See `install/22-LEADS.md`.
- ✨ **New tab: Radar** — your 24/7 AI-news watcher. It sweeps X for the day's biggest AI stories, ranks them, and hands you each one with your angle + a ready-to-post hook. One click drafts an X post; another can publish an SEO article to your own WordPress. Rides your Grok login — no API key. See `install/23-RADAR.md`.
- 🔒 **Both new tabs are fully yours** — Radar writes in *your* voice to *your* sites (author/bio/links are config-driven, generic by default), and Leads uses *your* keys. Nothing hardcoded to anyone else.

## 2026-06-23
- 🤝 **No Claude subscription needed — any agent can set it up** — the README made it sound like you must use Claude Code. You don't. Claude Code, **Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Hermes**, or **Free Claude Code** ($0) all read the same `SETUP-WITH-AI.md` and set everything up the same way. The setup guide now says this clearly, so members on Hermes + OpenRouter (no Claude plan) aren't put off. *(Thanks Muhamad for raising it.)*
- 🪟🤖 **Update safely on Windows or with any AI agent** — new `UPDATE-WITH-AI.md`: a cross-platform updater that **Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor** can run for you on **Mac, Windows, or Linux** (the old double-click updater was Mac-only). It backs up first, keeps all your settings/keys/vault, applies the update in the right order, rebuilds, checks the dashboard opens, and tells you what changed — asking before anything risky. `UPDATE.md` now also has a native Windows (PowerShell) path. You can wire it to a one-word trigger like `$agent-os-update`. *(Thanks Ridz for the request.)*
- ⚡ **Mastermind: route each agent your own way (advanced)** — you can now repoint any AI Agent Mastermind agent to a different model or provider — including your **own** OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. your z.ai GLM key, Sakana, or a local server) — by adding a `roomAgents` block to `~/.agentic-os/config.json`. No code editing, and it survives updates. Example in `config.example.json`. *(Thanks Ridz for the idea.)*
- 📘 **Clarified how the AI Agent Mastermind works** — the group-chat tab runs each agent as a *different model via your OpenRouter key* (the one from your Hermes setup), with the Free Claude Code agent running on your local Ollama. The tab list used to say "no setup" — it actually needs your OpenRouter key. *(Thanks Ridz for the question.)*
- 🔧 **SEO Pack download fixed** — the **Download SEO Pack (.zip)** button in the SEO tab (and the SEO guide) said "unavailable" because the file was getting stripped out of the install. It's now included, so the download works. Nothing to unlock. *(Thanks Dan for flagging it.)*
- 🔧 **Every chat tab remembers the conversation now** — the **Hermes** chat tab used to treat each message as a brand-new conversation (amnesia). Fixed — and a new safeguard caught the **same issue lurking in the OpenClaw and Antigravity tabs too**, so those are fixed as well. All chat tabs now carry context across messages. *(Thanks Chad for the clear write-up.)*
- ⚖️ **Added a plain-English disclaimer** — a new `DISCLAIMER.md` (use at your own risk, "as is", no warranty, you're responsible for your own keys/costs/actions). It's linked at the top of the README, surfaced when you launch, and the AI-setup flow points it out. Nothing for you to do — just so everyone knows where they stand.
- 🔧 **Clearer Claude sign-in (no API key needed)** — the Claude tab uses **`claude login`** (works with your Claude subscription), not an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The guide now says so, the AI-setup flow no longer creates an empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (which could *break* your login), and `8-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` has a one-line fix if you saw that banner. *(Thanks Amita for flagging it.)*

## 2026-06-22
- ✨ **New tab: Sakana Fugu** — a vendor-agnostic **model council**: a panel of frontier models deliberates in parallel (with web search), then a judge writes one decisive verdict. Same idea as Fusion, but typically much cheaper per call — handy for high-volume agent loops. Add one key and it works. Setup: `install/17-EXTRA-MODELS.md`.
- 🧹 **Polish across the local/offline tools** — tidied the Local, Local Hermes Engine, Pipeline, Loop and Agent-Room internals (no setup changes for you).
- 🔒 **More de-personalisation** — removed a leftover "Goldie Bench" label from a workspace folder so your install stays generic.
- ⚡ **Optional SEO upgrade** — the SEO tab can use a `SERPAPI_KEY` for richer competitor SERP data (totally optional; it tells you in-app).

## 2026-06-21
- 🔧 **Gemini tab marked retired** — Google **retired the Gemini CLI on 18 June 2026** (free/Pro/Ultra) and replaced it with **Antigravity**. The Gemini tab + guide now say so and point you to the **Antigravity** tab (its direct successor). *(The optional Live-Translate Gemini API key is separate and still works.)*
- 📘 **Clearer on what an update keeps** — `UPDATE.md` now spells it out: an update **keeps** your settings, keys, vault and notes, and only swaps the app code. So put settings (like your vault path) in `~/.agentic-os/config.json` — they survive every update. Hand-edited source files get replaced each update by design, so don't keep your fixes there. *(Thanks Jason for the question.)*
- 🧠 **Tip added** — keep the `install/` docs in your Obsidian vault so your agents can use them as context when maintaining the OS (see `0-HOW-IT-ALL-WORKS.md`).
- ⚡ **Build reliability** — fixed a Next.js config setting that could fail `npm run build` on a fresh install.

## 2026-06-20
- 🔧 **Your install is now truly YOURS** — fixed a bug where a fresh Agent OS acted like it belonged to the creator: the Agent Room/Mastermind called you "Julian" and tried to reference his projects, and a few defaults pointed at his company and voice. Now every install is clean and personal — it uses **your** name, **your** vault, **your** company, **your** voice. Set your display name with `"userName"` in `~/.agentic-os/config.json` (defaults to "You"). *(Thanks Lenard for the heads-up!)*
- 🎙️ **Change the Jarvis voice (new guide)** — want Jarvis in your own voice, or a different one? Connect your ElevenLabs key and pick a voice — just **ask your AI**, choose it in **Video → Director**, or set `AGENTIC_OS_TTS_VOICE`. Full steps in `install/3-JARVIS-VOICE.md`.

## 2026-06-19
- ✨ **New tab: Agent Kanban** — give it a goal and a little team of **local, offline** agents works a live board for you: a **Planner** breaks it into cards, a **Builder** builds each one, a **Reviewer** checks it really landed — and every Done card previews live. Free, 100% on your machine (uses the same local engine as voice building). See `install/20-AGENT-KANBAN.md`.
- ✨ **New tab: Open Design** (advanced) — a local-first, open-source design studio embedded in the dashboard: generate prototypes, dashboards, decks, images, and motion graphics on your own machine. It's optional and needs a separate install, so it's marked advanced. See `install/21-OPEN-DESIGN.md`.

## 2026-06-18
- ✨ **New tab: Loop** — "loop engineering": tell it what *done* looks like, and a builder model works while the Fusion council verifies it adversarially, looping until the gate passes. You stop being the loop. Setup: `install/19-LOOP-ENGINEERING.md`.
- 📘 **New: "How It All Works" guide** — a 5-minute read that finally explains how Mission Control, the models, Hermes, Jarvis, and the pipeline fit together — and the #1 rule that prevents most problems: **the small free model (Gemma2) is only for the free on-device builder — don't route Hermes, video, or coding agents through it.** If your agents felt flaky or your videos came out as text/blobs, this is almost always why. See `install/0-HOW-IT-ALL-WORKS.md`. *(Thanks Michael for the detailed write-up.)*
- 🐧 **Linux instructions** — a clear Linux section in `install/1-CORE-DASHBOARD.md` (everything runs on Linux; only the double-click installers are Mac-only — you start it manually instead).
- ⚡ **Video tip** — the Video guide now explains that video quality depends on the *authoring* model: use a strong model (Claude/N2), not the tiny local one, or you'll get empty/blob videos.

## 2026-06-16
- 🔧 **Claude chat memory — now rock-solid** — earlier versions could still "forget" between messages on some setups (ask the capital of France → "Paris", then "what's the famous landmark *there*?" → it had no idea where "there" was). The Claude tab now reliably carries the whole conversation, so follow-up questions just work. *(Thanks Mike for flagging it was still happening.)*
- ✨ **New tab: Grok Build** — xAI's `grok-build` coding agent now has its own tab. Ask it to build games or apps and they land in your **Workspace** to play live. It runs on your **X Premium+ (SuperGrok)** plan — no API key, no per-message cost. Setup: `install/18-GROK-BUILD.md`.
- ⚡ **Hermes profiles — explained + easier to find** — in **Hermes → Chat**, if you haven't made any profiles yet you'll now see a short hint (so the profile quick-swap bar isn't a mystery when it's empty). The guide now explains what profiles are, that they're **yours** (you only ever see your own — not anyone else's), and how to create them with `hermes profile create`. See `install/4-HERMES.md`. *(Thanks Gavin for the question.)*

## 2026-06-15
- ✨ **Jarvis can brief you (daily or weekly)** — in the **Hermes → Hermes-Jarvis** tab, ask for a briefing and Jarvis reads your Obsidian vault to give you a real rundown: open to-dos, what you worked on, recent memory captures, your daily "Top 3", and weekly wins — with a spoken summary and headline. Past briefings are saved. Works best with your vault connected (`install/11-MEMORY-OBSIDIAN.md`). See `install/4-HERMES.md`.
- 🔧 **Claude chat now remembers the conversation** — the basic **Claude** tab used to forget everything between messages: ask "what's the capital of France?" → "Paris", then "what's the famous landmark there?" and it had no idea where "there" was. Now it keeps full context across the whole chat. A new **New chat** button starts fresh whenever you want. *(Thanks to the member who reported the "context disconnect".)*
- ⚡ **Much easier Obsidian setup** — connecting your notes (the Memory Galaxy + Jarvis's memory) is now simply *"ask your AI to connect my Obsidian vault"* — no hidden files to edit. The guide leads with the simple way and the AI does the rest. See `install/11-MEMORY-OBSIDIAN.md`. *(Thanks Jason for the feedback.)*

## 2026-06-14
- ✨ **Two new model tabs: GLM 5.2 & Fusion** — chat with Zhipu's GLM-5.2 and OpenRouter's Fusion (a blend of top models). Paste one key each, no install. See `install/17-EXTRA-MODELS.md`.
- ✨ **This day-by-day changelog** is now part of every pack, so you can always see what's new and when.
- 🔧 **Fixed an install that wouldn't build** — a type error (the Kimi agent was missing from one internal list) made `npm run build` fail on some setups, so the dashboard wouldn't start. It now builds cleanly for everyone. *(Thanks to Carter for the report.)*

## 2026-06-13
- ✨ **New tab: Kimi Code** — Moonshot's **Kimi K2.7** coding agent, alongside Claude/Codex. Install the CLI + `kimi login` → see `install/16-KIMI-CODE.md`.
- 🔧 **NotebookLM now connects for everyone** — fixed a bug where the Notebook tab looked for one person's folder (`spawn …ENOENT`). It now finds NotebookLM on *your* Mac automatically. Setup: `install/15-NOTEBOOKLM.md`.
- ⚡ **Claude model choice** — the Claude tab now defaults to **Opus 4.8** (reliable + lighter on your plan's tokens). Want maximum power? Switch to **Claude 5** in one line — see `install/7-AGENT-CLIS.md`.

## 2026-06-12
- ✨ **Memory Galaxy setup guide** — connect your Obsidian vault and your notes become a living galaxy (and Jarvis gains a real memory). New `install/11-MEMORY-OBSIDIAN.md`.
- ✨ **Video, Music & Game Studio guides** — render videos + AI avatars (`12`), make songs with Suno (`14`), and commission playable games (`13`).
- ⚡ **Every pack is now date-stamped** — the README shows the version/date up top so you always know how current you are.

## 2026-06-11
- ✨ **One-click updater** — double-click `Update Agent OS.command` to move to the newest version. It keeps all your settings, keys, and notes. No terminal, no re-install.
- ⚡ **Video tab makes real videos** — describe what you want and Claude 5 authors a full multi-scene video (not just a title card), with your real screenshots dropped in.
- ⚡ **Thumbnail Studio = faithful edits** — it now preserves your design and applies just the change you asked for (like ChatGPT), at full 1920×1080.

## 2026-06-10
- ✨ **Double-click to start** — `Start Agent OS.command` installs everything the first time and opens your dashboard. `Check My Setup.command` is a friendly health check that tells you what's set up and what isn't.
- 🔒 **More private by default** — the dashboard now answers **only your own computer** (nobody on your Wi-Fi can open it), and your key files are auto-locked to your account.
- ✨ **Claude 5 rolled in** + the full Hermes guide (all ten sections of that tab explained).

## 2026-06-09
- ⚡ **Jarvis runs silent** — no more beeps or boot sounds; just the voice when it answers.
- ✨ **Jarvis remembers you** — ask "what do you remember about…" or "what happened yesterday" and it reads your whole Obsidian vault to answer.
- ✨ **Group chat saved to your vault** — the AI Agent Mastermind keeps its history, so it shows on any device and survives a browser clear.
- ⚡ **Pipeline Gallery** — see your recent builds in a click-to-play grid.
- ⚡ **Thumbnail Studio** — lots of quality upgrades: full-res output, parallel versions, faithful prompts, a live timer.

## Earlier
- The foundation: the dashboard, Voice Building (Agent Factory), the Jarvis voice, Hermes, Free Claude Code, Paperclip (your AI company), and plain-English install guides for every part.
